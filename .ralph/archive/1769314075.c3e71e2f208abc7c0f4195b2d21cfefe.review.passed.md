# Review Passed: Task 1 - Add TimeoutErrorHandler Type Definition

## Summary
The implementation of Task 1 (TimeoutErrorHandler type definition) meets all acceptance criteria and is ready to proceed.

## Evaluation

### Task Completion: ✅ PASS
All acceptance criteria for Task 1 are met:
- ✅ TimeoutErrorHandler type defined with correct signature accepting NetworkNodeProtocol, timeout_type, server, error, and context
- ✅ Type accepts both sync (None) and async (Awaitable[None]) return types
- ✅ Located after AuthErrorHandler definition in common.py (lines 724-727)
- ✅ Required import (Awaitable) added to typing imports (line 13)

### Code Quality: ✅ PASS
- Follows existing code style conventions
- Multi-line formatting keeps lines near 80 characters
- Proper type annotations throughout
- No code comments needed for type alias (consistent with codebase style)

### Testing: ✅ PASS
Task 1 is a type definition that enables other functionality. Type definitions are not typically tested directly. The type will be validated through usage in Tasks 4 and 6 (TCPClient/UDPNode timeout handler implementation).

### Documentation: ✅ PASS
- Type signature is self-documenting
- Parameter names clearly indicate purpose:
  - `NetworkNodeProtocol`: The node experiencing the timeout
  - `str`: Timeout type descriptor (e.g., "request", "connect")
  - `tuple[str, int] | None`: Server address (optional for UDP)
  - `TimeoutError`: The exception that occurred
  - `dict[str, Any]`: Additional context for the handler

## Minor Suggestions

### None
The implementation is complete and follows all project conventions.

## Updated Task Status
- Task 1: In Review → **Done**

## Dependencies Unblocked
This change unblocks Tasks 4 and 6 (TCPClient/UDPNode timeout handler implementation) which can now proceed in parallel.
